      <description>Back in September 2017, I teamed up with a coworker to give a presentation for the Utah Golang User Group. We chose to share the lessons we had learned as we adopted and scaled Go as one of the core programming languages at Qualtrics. Our intended audience was companies and developers who were interested in trying out Go and increasing its use within an organization. Many companies are considering Go because its popularity has only continued to rise (for good reason), so I&amp;rsquo;m excited to repost this content via my blog.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share my top ten list of books new Software Engineers should invest in reading! These books have proved foundational in helping me transition from student to developer and deepen my skills.
First, a disclaimer: there are some great books missing from this list because I haven&amp;rsquo;t read them yet. I want this list to be as authentic as possible and therefore I will not recommend a book until I&amp;rsquo;ve read it cover to cover.</description>

      <title>What This Blog is All About</title>
      <link>https://backendology.com/2018/07/14/what-this-blog-is-all-about/</link>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Backendology&amp;rdquo;?  There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things (Phil Karlton).
 Or, my favorite variant:
 There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off by one errors (Unknown)
 Naming is hard. Backendology isn&amp;rsquo;t a real word. Like the programmer who decides to write a lengthy comment rather than coming up with a better name, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain what I intended when I named this blog Backendology.</description>

      <title>Yet Another Software Blog</title>
      <link>https://backendology.com/2018/07/02/yet-another-software-blog/</link>

      <description>Welcome! This is the first post of my blog. If you’re reading this, you’re either arriving right on the ground floor or somehow I kept up with my goal to have an updated blog and you&amp;rsquo;re reading an older post. Either way, I’ll consider you a founder. I hope that you can find value in the blog posts I have planned.
Why does the world need another software-focused blog? While it&amp;rsquo;s true that we already have plenty of popular software blogs out there, like Martin Fowler’s or Coding Horror, I recently convinced myself that *every* software engineer should have a blog.</description>
