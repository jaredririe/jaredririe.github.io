      <description>Caching is one of my favorite topics in technology. I&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to approach this problem from both a hardware and software perspective. This blog post will cover some of the basics of caching, yet focus on the importance of having multiple layers of caching in a system. I think this is a key point worth emphasizing as I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it commonly misunderstood.
A caching anecdote One of the systems I built at Qualtrics could be described as the &amp;ldquo;back of the backend&amp;rdquo; as it was a critical storage system that many services relied on, yet had no service dependencies itself.</description>

      <title>Microservices: Are We Making a Huge Mistake?</title>

      <description>There is a clear trend in the software industry moving away from large, monolithic systems to fine-grained services known as &amp;ldquo;microservices.&amp;rdquo; While compelling, microservices introduce their own set of challenges and fallacies. This post considers the benefits and drawbacks of a microservices architecture (MSA) and contemplates the question: are we making a huge mistake in adopting this kind of architecture?
Relationship to &amp;ldquo;distributed systems&amp;rdquo; First, let&amp;rsquo;s clear up some terminology that you may find confusing.</description>

      <title>What This Blog is All About</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Backendology&amp;rdquo;?  There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things (Phil Karlton).
 Or, my favorite variant:
 There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off by one errors (Unknown)
 Naming is hard. Backendology isn&amp;rsquo;t a real word. Like the programmer who decides to write a lengthy comment rather than coming up with a better name, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain what I intended when I named this blog Backendology.</description>
