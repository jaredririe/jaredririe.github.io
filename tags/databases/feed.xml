      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share my top ten list of books new Software Engineers should invest in reading! These books have proved foundational in helping me transition from student to developer and deepen my skills.
First, a disclaimer: there are some great books missing from this list because I haven&amp;rsquo;t read them yet. I want this list to be as authentic as possible and therefore I will not recommend a book until I&amp;rsquo;ve read it cover to cover.</description>

      <description>In the introduction to this blog, I mentioned that I love breaking down abstractions to understand what makes them tick. This blog post is the first of many that will break down a fascinating abstraction.
Abstraction Database indexes provide the abstraction of performant queries with the cost of some overhead during writes and additional storage space. As most workflows are read-heavy, the overhead of indexes is almost always worthwhile.</description>

      <title>What This Blog is All About</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Backendology&amp;rdquo;?  There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things (Phil Karlton).
 Or, my favorite variant:
 There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off by one errors (Unknown)
 Naming is hard. Backendology isn&amp;rsquo;t a real word. Like the programmer who decides to write a lengthy comment rather than coming up with a better name, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain what I intended when I named this blog Backendology.</description>
