  <h1 class="post-title">Designing a Comprehensive Course in Distributed Systems: Reading List</h1>
  <span class="post-date">September 10, 2018 &middot; Filed in <a href="/categories/distributed-systems">Distributed Systems</a></span>

  

<p>In a recent conversation at work, I learned about <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/index.html">MIT&rsquo;s distributed systems course</a>. As the majority of the content is available online through the course website, I was just about ready to dive in, follow the course, and report on what I learned. But then I had this thought: I am not formally a student anymore, so I should take more ownership of my learning. I should design my own comprehensive course in distributed systems!</p>

<p>My course doesn&rsquo;t have to be constrained to a semester in length or only lightly cover topics that I find important and compelling. I&rsquo;ll be able to take a more depth-first approach to learning. For example, after implementing the Raft consensus algorithm, if I feel like there is more to learn, I can take time to build an simple system which uses my Raft code. A university course on a broad topic such as distributed systems has to avoid depth like this in order to cover all the required content. As someone who has been in industry for a few years, I also have a rough idea of which concepts matter in practice because I&rsquo;ve run up against them and struggled to find time to understand them as well as I wanted.</p>

<h2 id="why-study-distributed-systems">Why study distributed systems?</h2>

<p>First, some motivation. Of all the things to learn about in our field, why study distributed systems? In that same conversation I mentioned above, one of my coworkers said it better than I could:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Developers <em>really</em> need to know how to deal with concurrency, think in that space, and stop thinking about programs as serial lists of instructions. There is <em>no</em> demand for someone who can&rsquo;t natively think about concurrency all over their algorithm and their code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He went on to argue that an understanding of distributed systems is becoming a hard prerequisite of work done by software developers. While testing and software practice can safely and easily be learned on the job, concepts related to asynchronous concurrent systems often cannot be. Misunderstandings in this regard lead to system outages and incur serious technical debt. To avoid making common mistakes and architecting poor systems, it&rsquo;s critical to take time to seriously learn distributed systems.</p>

<p>Personally, I feel like I have a good grasp of the fundamentals, but an important next step in my career is learning advanced concepts like consensus and broadcast. <em>Understanding abstractions a level or two below your usage is incredibly worthwhile, not to mention satisfying.</em> I want to understand the content necessary to be considered a so-called &ldquo;distributed systems engineer.&rdquo; I also think that a few years of distributed systems practice in industry have primed me to better understand these concepts. I&rsquo;ve covered many of them at a high level, so revisiting them with a new perspective will be helpful.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-reading-list">Creating a reading list</h2>

<p>What follows is a reading list to capture the breadth of the available content in distributed systems. I&rsquo;ll use it in my next blog post to design the schedule of my course. To create this list, I scoured the internet, literally following hundreds of links. If you are also interested in this topic, I recommend you do the same: make your own reading list that gets you excited to learn more. These are the resources I found most useful in creating my reading list:</p>

</ul>

<p>Distributed systems research is known for an abundance of papers. My reading list includes papers as they are the primary source of information in this field of study. Papers are also challenging and I want to get better at understanding them and using them as part of my learning.</p>

<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>

<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>

<p>The basics give a sense for why distributed systems present challenging problems. With the problems framed, it will make more sense why we have to think so carefully about the advanced concepts below. For example, understanding that the network is unreliable and packets regularly get dropped makes it clear why it&rsquo;s hard to get multiple nodes of a database to agree on the state of the data.</p>

<h3 id="consensus">Consensus</h3>

<p>The problem of achieving consensus is fundamental to distributed systems. These first several papers are true classics and known well by distributed systems engineers.</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;One of the most important results in distributed systems theory was published in April 1985 by Fischer, Lynch and Patterson. Their short paper &lsquo;Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process&rsquo;, which eventually won the Dijkstra award given to the most influential papers in distributed computing, definitively placed an upper bound on what it is possible to achieve with distributed processes in an asynchronous environment.&rdquo;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></li>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="paxos">Paxos</h4>

<p>Paxos is a solution to consensus proposed by Lamport himself, the author of several of the classic papers above. You&rsquo;ll hear his name a lot in distributed systems. It&rsquo;s known to be difficult to understand, yet was implemented in several successful distributed systems like Google&rsquo;s Chubby lock service.</p>

<h4 id="two-phase-and-three-phase-commit-2pc-and-3pc">Two-phase and three-phase commit (2PC and 3PC)</h4>

<p>2PC and 3PC do not attempt to solve consensus entirely. Instead, they limited in scope to transaction commit protocols. They are often compared to Paxos as understanding their differences is insightful.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="raft">Raft</h4>

<p>Raft, which is much newer than Paxos (2013 compared to 1989), is meant to be a simplified, understandable version of Paxos. It has quickly become a core part of the backbone of distributed systems as it&rsquo;s used in open source software like etcd and Consul.</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;In this lab you will build a fault-tolerant key/value storage service using your Raft library from lab 2. You key/value service will be a replicated state machine, consisting of several key/value servers that use Raft to maintain replication. Your key/value service should continue to process client requests as long as a majority of the servers are alive and can communicate, in spite of other failures or network partitions.&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;In this lab you&rsquo;ll build a key/value storage system that &ldquo;shards,&rdquo; or partitions, the keys over a set of replica groups. A shard is a subset of the key/value pairs; for example, all the keys starting with &ldquo;a&rdquo; might be one shard, all the keys starting with &ldquo;b&rdquo; another, etc. The reason for sharding is performance. Each replica group handles puts and gets for just a few of the shards, and the groups operate in parallel; thus total system throughput (puts and gets per unit time) increases in proportion to the number of groups.&rdquo;</li>

These problems cast doubt on the utility of CAP as a tool for reasoning about trade-offs in practical systems.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The lack of transactions in Bigtable led to frequent complaints from users, so Google made distributed transactions central to Spanner&rsquo;s design. Based on its experience with Bigtable, Google argues that it is better to have application programmers deal with performance problems due to overuse of transactions as bottlenecks arise, rather than always coding around the lack of transactions.&rdquo;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></li>
