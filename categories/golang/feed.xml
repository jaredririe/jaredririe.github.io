      <description>As my blog is still in its infancy, I have been exploring various blogging platforms and tools to find the ones that I would like to use moving forward.

      <description>Back in September 2017, I teamed up with a coworker to give a presentation for the Utah Golang User Group.

Our intended audience was companies and developers who were interested in trying out Go and increasing its use within an organization. Many companies are considering Go because its popularity has only continued to rise (for good reason), so I&amp;rsquo;m excited to repost this content via my blog.</description>
